# Hotel-Booking-Project

This is an exploratory data analysis project of hotel booking data in Python. I utilized pandas, numpys, seaborn, and matplot libraries to assist with analyzing the datset.
I started off by cleaning the data which included removing unnecessary data, removing duplicates, removing null values and correcting the data values.
Next, I started working on understanding the causes behind the cancelations of reservations and gaining insights into the data that could help solve this problem.
